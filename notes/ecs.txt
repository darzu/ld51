Example from Mozilla ECSY:
  // MovableSystem
  class MovableSystem extends System {
    // This method will get called on every frame by default
    execute(delta, time) {
      // Iterate through all the entities on the query
      this.queries.moving.results.forEach(entity => {
        var velocity = entity.getComponent(Velocity);
        var position = entity.getMutableComponent(Position);
        position.x += velocity.x * delta;
        position.y += velocity.y * delta;

        if (position.x > canvasWidth + SHAPE_HALF_SIZE) position.x = - SHAPE_HALF_SIZE;
        if (position.x < - SHAPE_HALF_SIZE) position.x = canvasWidth + SHAPE_HALF_SIZE;
        if (position.y > canvasHeight + SHAPE_HALF_SIZE) position.y = - SHAPE_HALF_SIZE;
        if (position.y < - SHAPE_HALF_SIZE) position.y = canvasHeight + SHAPE_HALF_SIZE;
      });
    }
  }

  // Define a query of entities that have "Velocity" and "Position" components
  MovableSystem.queries = {
    moving: {
      components: [Velocity, Position]
    }
  }

ECS cadences
  Cadences can be disjoint (renderer vs simulation) 
  or multiples of each other (net to simulation)
