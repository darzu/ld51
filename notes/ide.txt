Collaborative editting:
  CRDTs, OT, or good ol multiplayer net code?
  CRDTs:

Multiplayer netcode debugger:
  Have split screen open,
  paused,
  user selects two objects and says "I expected these to be the same"
  "okay, which properties?"
  "color, location"
  "looks like ColorDef is only synced and creation and LocationDef is only modified via this event <>"

entity debugger:
  pause game, enter debugger
  on hover, show which components a given entity has 
    and which systems that qualifies them for
  
Interactive min-example generating:
  start by staticly analyzing, tree shaking / program slicing everything
  run dynamic analysis on the sample scene, cut everything that isn't used
  then run in immediate compile & prune mode,
    user deletes some code, tree shaking happens again, 
    sample is run, if it's good, dynamic prune runs again
  interactive commands:
    see number of call sites for each fn
    inline a fn, then do static and dynamic prunes
  special ECS aware unroller
  maybe:
    once the sample is small enough, u can just highlight lines in VSCode and it'll
      tell you weather it'll compile and how many lines could be cut
