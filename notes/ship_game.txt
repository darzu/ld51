APPEND ONLY. Just a stream of conciousness as the inspiration strikes.

Start docked and your goal is to reach the next dock along the river.
Oregon trail style, you can load out your ship at docks.
You can take a bigger gem which increases your payout but also the difficulty.
The river sometimes splits, with different challenges and rewards down different paths.
You can buy maps from docks that tell you splits, lengths, etc.
Sometimes you enter a large lake and you have to navigate edges to find tributaries.
River can get wider and narrower.
Maybe you are on the ocean somtimes and you need to sail w/ wind.
Maybe your bringing food and supplies to little towns.
You can hire AI crew.
Everyone needs to eat and drink?
You can lose supplies by getting damaged.
  Like the gem heart, supply boxes straddle multiple ship tiles and 
    all need to be broken before you loose them.
You can repair ship tiles.
Fire cannons and broad sides.
Steer to line up shots and follow the river.
Players wear hats depending on their job.
  Maybe done automatically based on station/turret.
The game lobby is just the ship at dock.

With more players, eventually just add another ship.
  Widen the river and add enemies to compensate.

Branches in the river are actually water falls.
  Makes it easier to have something floating above the waterfall to indicate.
  Makes it clear that it's one-way.
  Nice chance to reset.
  Obscures what is ahead.
