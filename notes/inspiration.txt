  naomi writing is just meeting notes back and forth
  character-driven writting
    people don't connect with a civilazation as a hole,
    so had to be character driven
  each writting:
    what's happening
    ptr to next clue
    back ptr to indicate how u could have gotten here,
      so u can follow the story the other direction
  characters r attached to certain plot lines
  players expected text to be lore, not game play
    had to make it clear: never lore, only text
  knew they needed shiplog b/c didn't want player using paper notes
    rumor board was a late addition
